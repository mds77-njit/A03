### Glossary {“GitHub Glossary.”}
**Branch** :- A barnch is parallel version of a repository. it is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or main branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "live" version.

**Clone**  :- A clone is a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere, or the act of making that copy.

**Commit** :- A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). When you make a commit to save your work, Git creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep record of the specific changes committed along with who made them and when.

**Fetch** :- When you use git fetch, you're adding changes from the remote repository to your local working branch without committing them.

**Git** :- Git is an open source program for tracking changes in text files.

**Github** :- GitHub Apps provide a service to an entire organization and use their own identity when performing their function.

**Merge** :- Merging takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another.

**Merge Conflict** :- A difference that occurs between merged branches.

**Push** :- To push means to send your committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub.com.

**Pull** :- Pull refers to when you are fetching in changes and merging them.

**Remote** :- This is the version of a repository or branch that is hosted on a server, most likely GitHub.com.

**Repository** :- A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to imagine as a project's folder.
